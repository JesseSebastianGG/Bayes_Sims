# Bayes_Sims

These simulations were created for providing an interractive introduction to Bayesian statistics.


The first is essentially Bayes' billiard balls, but with the context modified to a coin.
The second follows on from this by generating simulated data under the same likelihood.
These is useful for visualising various Beta distributions.
The third shows relationships between some conjugate pairs, including some predictive functions.
